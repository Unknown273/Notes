# Something Amazing about the script command

So the script commmand records everything that happens in the terminal once you start.
By the default it stores all of this information in a file named `typescript`.
If you do `cat typescript`, you'll see everything that happened in your terminal.
Your prompt, how you typed the command etc.

That's cool and all but what's even more crazier is that there is another associate of command called,
`scriptreplay`. Which as the name suggest, replays the script as it was recorded as a video file.
Amazing isn't it?
